# StoNED-Python

`StoNED-Python` project provides the python codes for estimating Convex Nonparametric Least Square (`CNLS`), Stochastic Nonparametric Envelopment of Data (`StoNED`), and their different variants. It allows the user to estimate the CNLS/StoNED models in an open-access environment rather than in commercial software, e.g., GAMS, MATLAB. The `StoNED-Python` project is built based on the [CVXOPT](https://cvxopt.org/).
