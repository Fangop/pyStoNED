# StoNED-Python

`StoNED-Python` project provides the python codes for estimating Convex Nonparametric Least Square (`CNLS`), Stochastic Nonparametric Envelopment of Data (`StoNED`), and their different variants. It allows the user to estimate the CNLS/StoNED models in an open access environment rather than in commercial softwares, e.g., GAMS, MATLAB. The `StoNED-Python` project is built based on the [CVXOPT](https://cvxopt.org/). 

It allows the user to formulate convex optimization problems in a natural mathematical syntax rather than the restrictive standard form required by most solvers. The user specifies an objective and set of constraints by combining constants, variables, and parameters using a library of functions with known mathematical properties. CVXR then applies signed disciplined convex programming (DCP) to verify the problemâ€™s convexity. Once verified, the problem is converted into standard conic form using graph implementations and passed to a cone solver such as ECOS or SCS.
